# Getting Started with [Sparked Paste](https://paste.sparked.host)

## What is Sparked Paste?

Sparked Paste is a service, originally made by [toptal](https://github.com/toptal/haste-server), but has been forked by the [Sparked Host LLC DevOps Team](https://sparkedhost.com/about-us) to include a better looking theme and more features. This website provides the ability for clients to send server logs and configuration files easily with our Support Team and our Community.

## How do I use Sparked Paste?

1) First, navigate to the main page [here](https://paste.sparked.host).
2) You will be greeted by a dark gray page where you can type (or paste) text, code, or configurations.
3) Once you're done, you will see a save button on the top right corner of the page, click on that to save it, or use Control + S.
4) The URL on your browser will update, and syntax highlighting will be applied to your paste. Copy that new URL and send it wherever you want.
