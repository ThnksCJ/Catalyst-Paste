# Sparked Paste

Welcome to our Sparked Paste service. We may ask you to visit this site in order to
paste logs, or may have been sent a link to paste.sparked.host by one of our staff
members. The main purpose of this tool is to share code snippets, configs, server logs,
errors...

## How to Use

Please navigate to [howtouse.md](https://paste.sparked.host/howtouse.md)

## Duration

Pastes will stay for 30 days from their last view. They may be removed earlier
and without notice.

## Privacy

While the contents of paste.sparked.host are not directly crawled by any search robot
that obeys "robots.txt", there should be no great expectation of privacy.  Post
things at your own risk. Not responsible for any loss of data or removed
pastes.

## Open Source

This service is powered by Sparked-Paste, a fork of the open-source project haste-server.
